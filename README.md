# Simon game

"Simon game" is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))). The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails the game is over.
